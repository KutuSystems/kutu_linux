User IOCTL commands for IND

IND_USER_RESET:

if arg = FPGA_RESET then put fgpa in reset, if arg = anything else then release from reset.

IND_USER_SET_MODE:

arg = IND_cmd_struct

structure has 4 arguments.

config -> configuration constnats.  For normal operation is 0, for various test modes use other bits.
address -> initial DMA address.  This is an offset address within 128Mbyte block, normally start with 0.
capture_count -> number of ADC samples to capture. must be multiple of 4. Total number of samples captured is this value * 3
delay_count -> number of ADC samples to ignore during capture. Must be multiple of 4.  Allow enough time for selector
to settle.

IND_USER_SET_ADDRESS:

arg = dma write address.  Update this after every scan.

IND_USER_DMA_TEST:

arg = transfer size
This is a loopback test for transferring DMA data.

IND_USER_TRIG_PPS:

trigger a dma_capture when in PPS debug mode.

IND_USER_SPI_WRITE:

write to SPI port

IND_USER_STATUS:

return status word

IND_USER_SET_LEDS:

Set user LEDS

IND_USER_CLEAR_LEDS:

Clear user LEDS

IND_USER_GET_SEM:

read back interrupt semaphore

IND_USER_SET_SEM:

set user semaphore

IND_USER_REG_DEBUG:
